3. **Resource Utilization:**
   - CPU spikes to 90%+ during 40% of peak hours
   - Uneven memory utilization: 30-95% fluctuation
   - Storage I/O bottlenecks during 25% of the time

**Stakeholders Affected:**
- **End Users (500,000+):** Slow experience, timeout errors
- **Development Teams (50 developers):** Difficult troubleshooting, lack of visibility
- **Operations Team (8 DBAs):** Reactive firefighting, manual tuning
- **Business Units:** Revenue loss, customer complaints
- **Executive Leadership:** Compliance risks, competitive disadvantage

**Business Consequences of Inaction:**
- **Revenue Impact:** $500,000/year from user churn and transaction failures
- **Operational Cost:** $200,000/year for manual DBA efforts
- **Compliance Risk:** Potential fines from SLA violations
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** 25% slower response time compared to competitors
- **Technical Debt:** Increasing complexity, harder maintenance

**Market Opportunity:**
