# Query Optimization Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Query Optimization?

Query optimization is the process of improving database query performance through various techniques including index optimization, query rewriting, and execution plan analysis.

> **Info**: Effective query optimization can improve performance by 70% or more while reducing resource consumption.

---

## ðŸš€ Optimization Techniques

### 1. Index Optimization
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for complex queries
- **Partial Indexes**: Indexes with WHERE conditions
- **Covering Indexes**: Include all needed columns
- **Index Maintenance**: Regular monitoring and cleanup

### 2. Query Rewriting
- **Subquery Optimization**: Convert to JOINs where appropriate
- **Window Functions**: Replace multiple GROUP BY queries
- **CTE Usage**: Common Table Expressions for complex logic
- **LIMIT Usage**: Reduce result set size

### 3. Execution Plan Analysis
- **EXPLAIN Analysis**: Understand query execution
- **Cost Analysis**: Identify expensive operations
- **Join Optimization**: Choose appropriate join types
- **Sort Optimization**: Minimize sorting operations

## ðŸ“Š Performance Impact

### Before vs After Optimization

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Query Response Time** | 3-5 seconds | 1-1.5 seconds | **70%** |
| **Resource Usage** | High CPU/IO | Optimized | **60%** |
| **Throughput** | 100 QPS | 250 QPS | **150%** |
| **Index Hit Ratio** | 75% | 95% | **27%** |

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Identify Bottlenecks
1. **Monitor slow queries** using Performance Insights
2. **Analyze execution plans** for expensive operations
3. **Identify missing indexes** through query patterns
4. **Review table statistics** and data distribution

### Phase 2: Implement Optimizations
1. **Create targeted indexes** for slow queries
2. **Rewrite inefficient queries** using best practices
3. **Optimize JOIN operations** and conditions
4. **Implement query result caching** where appropriate

### Phase 3: Monitor and Validate
1. **Measure performance improvements** using metrics
2. **Monitor resource utilization** changes
3. **Validate business logic** remains correct
4. **Document optimization changes** for future reference

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Wins

> **Quick Win #1**: Add indexes on frequently filtered columns - can provide immediate 50-80% performance improvement.

> **Quick Win #2**: Use LIMIT clauses to reduce result set size - especially effective for pagination queries.

> **Quick Win #3**: Replace SELECT * with specific column names - reduces I/O and network overhead.

## ðŸ”§ Optimization Tools

### PostgreSQL
```sql
-- Analyze query
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;

-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### MySQL
```sql
-- Analyze query
EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;

-- Find slow queries
SELECT DIGEST_TEXT, AVG_TIMER_WAIT/1000000000 as avg_time_sec, COUNT_STAR
FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER BY AVG_TIMER_WAIT DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check index usage
SHOW INDEX FROM orders;
```

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Common Optimization Patterns

### 1. JOIN Optimization
```sql
-- Before: Inefficient subquery
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE total > 1000);

-- After: More efficient JOIN
SELECT DISTINCT c.* FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.total > 1000;
```

### 2. Pagination Optimization
```sql
-- Before: Inefficient OFFSET for large pages
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY created_at OFFSET 10000 LIMIT 20;

-- After: Cursor-based pagination
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE created_at > '2023-01-01 10:00:00'
ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 20;
```

### 3. COUNT Optimization
```sql
-- Before: Slow COUNT(*) on large tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed';

-- After: Use approximate count or cached value
SELECT reltuples::BIGINT AS estimate
FROM pg_class
WHERE relname = 'orders';
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### Query Design
1. **Use effective WHERE clauses**: Place most selective conditions first
2. **Avoid SELECT ***: Only select needed columns
3. **Use LIMIT**: Restrict results when possible
4. **Optimize ORDER BY**: Use indexes for sorting

### Index Design
1. **Composite indexes**: Column order matters
2. **Covering indexes**: Include all needed columns
3. **Partial indexes**: For specific conditions
4. **Index maintenance**: Remove unused indexes

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Track slow queries**: Set appropriate thresholds
2. **Analyze execution plans**: Understand query costs
3. **Monitor resource usage**: CPU, I/O, memory
4. **Regular benchmarking**: Compare performance over time
