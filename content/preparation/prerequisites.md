## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Assessment

### Current Environment Audit

#### Database Inventory
Create a comprehensive inventory of your databases:

```sql
-- Example inventory query for PostgreSQL
SELECT 
    datname as database_name,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) as size,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = d.datname) as active_connections
FROM pg_database d
WHERE datistemplate = false;
```

#### Performance Baseline
Establish current performance metrics:

| Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Gap |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Average Query Time** | ___ seconds | < 2 seconds | ___ |
| **Peak Connections** | ___ | < 80% of max | ___ |
| **CPU Utilization** | ___% | < 80% | ___ |
| **Storage Usage** | ___% | < 85% | ___ |
| **IOPS Utilization** | ___% | < 80% | ___ |

#### Application Analysis
- **Query Patterns**: Identify most common query types
- **Peak Usage Times**: Understand traffic patterns
- **Critical Transactions**: Identify business-critical operations
- **Performance SLAs**: Document current service level agreements

## üí∞ Cost Planning

### Performance Insights Costs

#### Free Tier (Default)
- **Retention Period**: 7 days
- **Cost**: No additional charge
- **Suitable For**: Development, testing, basic monitoring

#### Extended Retention
- **Retention Period**: Up to 2 years
- **Cost**: $0.02 per vCPU per day
- **Example**: db.r5.xlarge (4 vCPUs) = $2.88/month for 1 month retention

### Implementation Costs

#### One-time Costs
- **Training**: $5,000 - $15,000 per team member
- **Consulting**: $20,000 - $50,000 for implementation assistance
- **Tools/Software**: $10,000 - $25,000 for additional monitoring tools
- **Testing**: $5,000 - $10,000 for non-production environment setup

#### Ongoing Costs
- **Extended Retention**: $50 - $500/month depending on database size
- **Additional Monitoring**: $100 - $1,000/month for third-party tools
- **Maintenance**: 10-20% of DBA time for ongoing optimization
- **Training Updates**: $2,000 - $5,000/year for skill maintenance
